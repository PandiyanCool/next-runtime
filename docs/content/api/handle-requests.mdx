title: Handle Requests
---

Handle is the core method of this project. It wraps your `getServerSideProps`
handler so that you can handle `post` requests in addition to `get` requests,
and so that you'll have an automatically generated JSON api as well.

## Handle `GET` requests

Define the `get` handler to support `GET` requests, the standard
`getServerSideProps` functionality that you're already familiar with. The return
value from this handler is passed as props to the page component when the user
visits the page.

```ts
import { handle, json } from 'next-runtime';

export const getServerSideProps = handle({
  async get(context) {
    return json({
      name: 'Stephan Meijer',
      country: 'Netherlands',
    });
  },
});
```

The `context` parameter is the object as provided by Next.js
[`GetServerSidePropsContext`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getserversideprops-server-side-rendering)
extended with [cookie](/api/cookies) and [header](/api/headers) handlers as well
as query expansion.

### Query expansion

When using `next-runtime`, URL Search Parameters are expanded. Take the
following url:

```
https://example.com?person.name=smeijer&person.age=34
```

Without using `next-runtime`, `context.query` would look like:

```js
context.query = {
  'person.name': 'smeijer',
  'person.age': '34',
};
```

With query expansion that becomes:

```js
context.query = {
  person: {
    name: 'smeijer',
    age: '34',
  },
};
```

This works with arrays as well (`person[n].name`).

### Get JSON API

Users don't always visit a web page to consume their information. Sometimes,
they want to use a shell script, and request data in JSON format. Every
`next-runtime` handler also serves as JSON endpoint. Even the `get` handler.
Request the same page via curl, and you'll be served JSON instead.

```shell
curl -H "Accept: application/json" https://example.com/page-path
# » { name: 'Stephan Meijer', country: 'Netherlands' }
```

## Handle `POST` Requests

Define the `post` handler to support `POST` requests. Post requests can be used
to submit forms to the current page, without the need to create an
[`api-route`](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction).

```ts
import { handle, json } from 'next-runtime';

export const getServerSideProps = handle({
  async post(context) {
    return json({
      name: 'Stephan Meijer',
      country: 'Netherlands',
    });
  },
});
```

The `context` parameter is the object as provided by Next.js
[`GetServerSidePropsContext`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getserversideprops-server-side-rendering)
extended with [cookie](/api/cookies) and [header](/api/headers) handlers, and a
populated `req.body`.

### Post Request Body

The request body contains an object, holding the contents that were submitted by
the form or json post request.

For example, take the following form:

```html
<form action="post">
  <input name="name" />
  <input country="country" />
</form>
```

When the user would submit that form with the values `Person` and `Some Place`,
`req.body` would equal:

```js
req.body = {
  name: 'Person',
  country: 'Some Place',
};
```

Note that [`query expansion`](#query-expansion) is applied to the request body
as well. A submitted field name like `persons[0].name` translates to a
`req.body` like `{ persons: [{ name: '' }]`.

### Post JSON API

Submitting a form is one way to receive post data, but every post handler also
automatically serves as an api route. Users might just as well open curl and
post data via the terminal:

```shell
curl \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "name": "Stephan", "country": "Netherlands" }' \
  https://example.com/page-path
```

## Handle `PATCH` Requests

Define the `patch` handler to support `PATCH` requests. They behave the same as
`POST` requests, so please [check there](#handle-post-requests) for more
specifics.

```ts
import { handle, json } from 'next-runtime';

export const getServerSideProps = handle({
  async patch() {},
});
```

## Handle `PUT` Requests

Define the `put` handler to support `PUT` requests. They behave the same as
`POST` requests, so please [check there](#handle-post-requests) for more
specifics.

```ts
import { handle, json } from 'next-runtime';

export const getServerSideProps = handle({
  async put() {},
});
```

## Handle `DELETE` Requests

Define the `delete` handler to support `DELETE` requests. They behave the same
as `POST` requests, so please [check there](#handle-post-requests) for more
specifics.

```ts
import { handle, json } from 'next-runtime';

export const getServerSideProps = handle({
  async delete() {},
});
```

## Handle File Uploads

To allow `POST`, `PATCH` and `PUT` requests to include files, you'll need to set
the `uploadDir` or define the `upload` handler. Note that this a supporting
handler that accompanies the method handlers. You can have a `post` without an
`upload` handler, but an `upload` without a `post` makes no sense. When neither
of the options are provided, file uploads will be ignored.

The examples below are based on the following form:

```html
<form action="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <input name="file" type="file" />
</form>
```

### `uploadDir`

The easiest way to support file uploads, is by setting the `uploadDir` option.
When providing this option, files will be written to the local file system in
the directory of your choice. Files will be stored with randomly generated
filenames, and the full path will be available as `file.path` in the request
body.

```ts
import { handle, json } from 'next-runtime';

export const getServerSideProps = handle({
  uploadDir: '/uploads',

  async post({ req: { body } }) {
    return json({
      message: `Your file is stored at ${body.file.path}.`,
    });
  },
});
```

### `upload` handler

A more advanced method to handle file uploads, is by defining the `upload`
handler. The upload handler receives an object as argument, holding three
properties:

- **field** _string_

  The form field name under which the file was selected.

- **file** _{ name: string, size: number, type: string }_

  The file descriptor providing data about the uploaded file.

- **stream** _ReadableStream_

  The stream to be piped to stream writers.

Use the readable stream to pipe the file upload directly to an object store like
Amazon S3 or Digital Ocean spaces.

```ts
import { handle, json } from 'next-runtime';

export const getServerSideProps = handle({
  async upload({ field, file, stream }) {
    stream.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(`/uploads/${file.name}`));
  },

  async post({ req: { body } }) {
    return json({
      message: `Your file is stored at ${body.file.path}.`,
    });
  },
});
```

### Upload API

Uploads can be done via the api route as well. For that, it depends on the
`post` handler. Give it a shot with the following CURL command:

```bash
curl --form file='@photo.png' https://example.com/page-path
```

## Limits

We use a combination of
[`body-parser`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser) and
[`busboy`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/busboy) to parse the incoming data,
together with our own glue for `query expansion`.

To protect your apis from being misused, it's possible to add restrictions using
the `limits` option. All limits are optional.

```js
import { handle } from 'next-runtime';

export const getServerSideProps = handle({
  limits: {},
});
```

The following options are available.

- **fileCount** _number_

  The maximum number of files a user can upload.

- **fileSize** _number | string_

  The maximum size per file in bytes. ¹⁾

- **fieldSize** _number | string_

  The maximum size per field in bytes. ¹⁾

- **jsonSize** _number | string_

  The maximum size of the full json payload. ¹⁾

- **mimeType** _string_

  A comma-separated list of one or more file types or unique file type
  specifiers to only accept files of certain types. See
  [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/accept) for
  more info. It's the same accept string as `<input type="file" accept="..." />`
  uses.

## TypeScript

`handle` accepts three type parameters. The first two are what you're familiar
with from Next.js, `PageProps` and `UrlQuery`. PageProps is used to shape the
`get` and `post` return value, while `UrlQuery` is used to shape
`context.params`. The last one, `FormData` is one that we added and applies to
`req.body`.

Our `RuntimeContext` extends `GetServerSidepropsContext` with convenient
[cookie](/api/cookies) and [header](/api/headers) helpers.

```ts
export const getServerSideProps = handle<PageProps, UrlQuery, FormData>({
  async upload({ file: File, stream: ReadableStream }): void {},
  async get({ params: UrlQuery }: RuntimeContext): RuntimeResponse {},
  async post({ req: { body: FormData } }: RuntimeContext): RuntimeResponse {},
  async put({ req: { body: FormData } }: RuntimeContext): RuntimeResponse {},
  async patch({ req: { body: FormData } }: RuntimeContext): RuntimeResponse {},
  async delete({ req: { body: FormData } }: RuntimeContext): RuntimeResponse {},
});
```
